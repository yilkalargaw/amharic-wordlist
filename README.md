# amharic-wordlist
This repostiory is ment to hold a word list of amharic words which I intend to use for hunspell and aspell spell correction dictionaries. The original word list was compiled by Daniel Yacob of the the Gee'z Frontier Foundation and was extracted from the aspell-am dictionary. It was licenced as Public Domain and this list would also be in the public domain.

The intention of this project is to make the word list a community sourced and updatable list for various spell dictionaries, sematic analyzers or any other project that requires an amharic wordlist. Most of the words contained are root words and various affixation rules can be used to further expand the list. Any help is appreciated and welcome.

# notice
Since the wordlist was originally intended for use as a spellchecking librarry it does contain some words that are not strictly of amharic origin but often appear in amharic writing. In the future a tagging system may be devised for such words. e.g. (ኮምፓስ, ኮሌጅ)
