# amharic-wordlist
This repostiory is ment to hold a word list of amharic words which I intend to use a hunspell and aspell spell correction dictionary. The original word list was compiled by Daniel Yacob of the the Gee'z Frontier Foundation and was extracted from the aspell-am dictionary. It was licenced as Public Domain and this list would also be in the public domain.

The intention of this project is to make the word list a community sourced and updatable list that will one day be a usable word list for various spell dictionaries. The words mainly contained are mostly root words since various affixation rules can be used to further expand the list. Any help is appreciated.
